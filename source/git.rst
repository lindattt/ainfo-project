What is a version control platform?
-----------------------------------

Version control platforms are platforms that allow you to keep track of the changes done to your project over time, and to resume an older version if needed.

In order to manage properly a new project, it is useful to create a repository in a version control platform. 

GitHub and GitLab
-----------------

The most popular platforms of this kind are **GitHub** and **GitLab**. Those platforms have different features, but they share the same Git environment, so no matter which one you choose to work with, the content of the GitHub repository and of the GitLab repository will be the same, and also the shell commands you need to know to work from locally from your computer.
