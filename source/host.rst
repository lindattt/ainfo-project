What is a hosting service
-------------------------

If you followed the steps described in the :ref:`previous pages <sphinx>` of this tutorial, you should have been able to generate **HTML pages** starting from reST documents, using Sphinx.

Those HTML pages though are stored **locally** in your computer memory; you may want them to be publicly available **on the web**. That's when hosting services come into play.

A **hosting service** is what allows you to host your documentation on a server and let it be accessible publicly.
