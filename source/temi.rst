Sphinx supports changing the appearance of its HTML output via themes. A theme is a collection of HTML templates, stylesheet(s) and other static files. Additionally, it has a configuration file which specifies from which theme to inherit, which highlighting style to use, and what options exist for customizing the themeâ€™s look and feel.

Themes are meant to be project-unaware, so they can be used for different projects without change.

There are plenty of free themes that you can choose. Here you can find some examples: https://sphinx-themes.org


How to change the theme of your project?
It is simple. You need to install the theme 

.. code-block:: shell

	pip install
